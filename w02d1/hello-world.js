//
// OUR GOAL: to establish some test code 'along side but independent from' our main code.
//

// STEP 1) implement a function called sayHello that takes the name of 
// the saluted person and returns what would be said.

const sayHello = () => {
};


// test the code, here at first, and then factor it out to be separate
// by making the functions exportable

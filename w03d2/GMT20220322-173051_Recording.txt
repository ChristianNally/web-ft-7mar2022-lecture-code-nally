00:14:10	Alvin Tolentino:	Shouldn‚Äôt this diagram have a branch that responds to errors?
00:29:26	Nicole MacLean:	Bread types
00:29:59	Iaan Johnston (he/him):	pumpernickle
00:30:13	Tony Yu:	Sourdough
00:30:18	Tony Yu:	Bagel
00:30:20	lucky:	Whole grain
00:30:22	Tony Yu:	Dinner rolls
00:44:12	Matt Seligman:	maybe the file isn't saved after removing the extra directory
00:44:19	Bailey Dods:	Not sure if we reset since we changed the two ids
00:44:37	Matt Seligman:	oh reset server
00:57:15	Matt Seligman:	would "this.id" work for the type index as well?
00:59:30	Matt Seligman:	that would make sense
00:59:56	Eugene Helland:	The object would not be instantiated yet
01:01:51	Tony Yu:	HAHAHAHA
01:01:54	Eugene Helland:	LOL
01:24:17	Eugene Helland:	would you remove calls to packages like morgan in the production version of your software?
01:31:24	Iaan Johnston (he/him):	I misspelled before, it's pumpernickel
01:31:32	Tony Yu:	^^
01:39:43	Lucas Tan:	should it have submit?
01:43:41	Lucas Tan:	so when the server is closed does the pumpernickel goes away from the breadtypes array?
01:45:02	Tony Yu:	Yikes
01:46:20	Bailey Dods:	params
01:46:21	Ryan Kwok:	params
01:46:21	Matt Seligman:	params.id
01:46:22	Nicole MacLean:	Req.params
01:46:22	Tony Yu:	PARAMS
01:46:22	Alvin Tolentino:	Params.id
01:52:30	Dustin Grof:	edit: bannock!
01:56:48	Lucas Tan:	if you use app.post for edit, does that mean you can no longer have an app.post for create to add breadtypes?
01:57:42	Saida:	We have app.post for /new
01:58:03	Saida:	Where we still can add new types
02:01:40	Alvin Tolentino:	Is there a difference between <%- ‚Ä¶ %> and <%=  ‚Ä¶ %>?
02:02:15	Matt Seligman:	- is include
02:02:16	Tony Yu:	woah
02:02:25	Matt Seligman:	so you can include files with -
02:03:17	Alvin Tolentino:	tyty
02:03:32	Grace:	Do you always omit semicolon for the js part in a pjs file?
02:04:08	Grace:	ejs**
02:06:47	Richard:	Why do you need a pair of alligator clips after the curly brace
02:07:05	Tony Yu:	HHAHAAH
02:08:13	Lucas Tan:	does the order of create, update, delete, etc. matter in the code?
02:08:40	Matt Seligman:	splice(id,1)
02:09:12	Matt Seligman:	*learnt about "delete" * just now :O
